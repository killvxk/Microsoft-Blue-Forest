# How to Apply Security Baselines to Non-Domain Joined machines running Windows 10 Version 2009 (Draft) 

Notes: I will update this post when this gets out of Draft status.

1. Download Windows-10-Windows Server-v20H2-Security-Baseline-DRAFT.zip:

   https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/gxcuf89792/attachments/gxcuf89792/Microsoft-Security-Baselines/219/1/Windows-10-Windows%20Server-v20H2-Security-Baseline-DRAFT.zip  
  
2. Extract the contents of the zip file. 

3. Download LGPO.zip from the Security compliance toolkit:
   
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319
    
   Place the LGPO.exe in the following directory where your security baseline folder is located:
   
   Windows-10-Windows Server-v2004-Security-Baseline-DRAFT\Scripts\Tools

4. Open Powershell in administrative mode and temporarily set the execution policy of powershell to unrestricted with the following code:

   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   ```
   
5. Run the following from the Local_Script folder from the zip file you extracted from Step 2:

   ```
   .\Baseline-LocalInstall.ps1 -Win10NonDomainJoined
   ```

6. At this point the following baselines referenced below will automatically install:

7. Set execution policy back to restricted mode
  
   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted
   ```
   
 
9. Type the following in an administrative command prompt window to put Windows Defender into a sandboxed mode

    ```
    setx /M MP_FORCE_USE_SANDBOX 1
    ```
    The following reference url will explain more about this setting: https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/10/26/windows-defender-antivirus-can-now-run-in-a-sandbox/
    
10. Remove PowerShell 2.0 from administrative command prompt window:

```
Dism /online /Disable-Feature /FeatureName:"MicrosoftWindowsPowerShellV2Root"
```

## Microsoft Edge Chromium Security

1. To Download Microsoft Edge, including the latest channel version and policy files. Go to the following link:

   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/business/download
   
2. Place the policy files in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions

   - ADMX files go in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions
   
   - ADML files go in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US
   
3. Microsoft Edge Security baselines can be downloaded from the Microsoft Security Compliance toolkit:

   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319
   
4. You will need to manually open gpedit.msc (Group Policy Editor) and set the following policies for Microsoft Edge:

## Bitlocker Security

By default bitlocker is configured with XTS-AES-128 encryption and preboot authentication is left off by default. Its highly recommended that you turn on preboot authentication. Preboot authentication is explained in the following document for bitlocker countermeasures:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-countermeasures

Preboot authentication can be turned on in the following location for your operating system.

Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Bitlocker Drive Encryption\Operating System Drives\Require Additional Authentication at startup

If your host machine has a TPM chip set the following options:

If your host machine does not have a TPM chip set the following options:

![](https://github.com/rootsecdev/Microsoft-Blue-Forest/blob/master/Screenshots/StandAlone1903-2.PNG)

(Optional) Configure OS encryption to XTS-AES-256

The option to use AES256 over AES128 is optional. Both provide an adequate layer data encryption protection of hard disks when the device is powered off. However, if you are in the goverment sector or in a federally regulated environment you should be using an AES256 suite to protect data. Further guidance can be found at:

https://apps.nsa.gov/iaarchive/programs/iad-initiatives/cnsa-suite.cfm

Encryption options can be set at the following location:

Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Bitlocker Drive Encryption

At this point right click on your C (OS Drive) and turn on bitlocker

## Office 365 Security

The following can be used in conjuction with Windows 10 hardening. It is extremely important to have adequate Microsoft Office security protections enabled as they can be a frequent attack vector for hackers. For Example DDE attacks https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/malware-embedded-microsoft-office-documents-dde-exploit-macroless/

1. To Start download the Office 365 Pro Plus zip file from the security compliance toolkit

   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=55319
   
1a. Also download LGPO.zip from the Security compliance toolkit from the URL above and extract the LGPO.exe file to:
    Windows 10 Version 1903 and Windows Server Version 1903 Security Baseline\Local_Script\Tools

2. Download the Office 365 admin templates from the following link: (Hint: 64 bit is the default install now for Office in unmanaged environments)

   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49030
   
3. Extact the Office 365 templates to a directory of your chosing. For my example I put it in a c:\temp directory called "C:\temp\Office365 Templates\"

4. Copy the ADMX files from my example above from the following locations:
   
   From: C:\temp\Office365 Templates\admx
   
   To: C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions
   
5. Copy the ADML files from my example about to the following locations:

   From: C:\temp\Office365 Templates\admx\en-us
   
   To: C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions\en-US
   
 6. Exact the Office 365 zip file from the security compliance toolkit to c:\temp\
 
 7. Navigate to the following folder in a elevated powershell session:
    
    C:\temp\Office365-ProPlus-Sept2019-FINAL\Scripts
    
 8. Open Powershell in administrative mode and temporarily set the execution policy of powershell to unrestricted with the following    code:

   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
   ``` 
 
 9. Run the following powerhsell command as shown:
 
   ```
   .\Baseline-LocalInstall.ps1 
   ```
   
   The following switches are supported if you don't want to install certain Office 365 hardening techniques:
   
   -NoRequiredMacroSigning - Doesn't install the GPO that disallows execution of unsigned macros.
                             If this switch is not specified, unsigned macros will not execute.

   -NoLegacyFileBlock      - Doesn't install the GPO that disallows the loading or saving of
                             legacy file formats, such as .doc, .dot, .xls, etc.

   -NoExcelDDEBlock        - Doesn't install the GPO that blocks Excel from performing DDE
                             lookup or launch.

 ## Privacy Focused settings
 
 Its important to review the privacy settings on your Windows 10 OS. Microsoft has done a excellent job at putting all privacy focuses settings into a single area for ready review.You can review your privacy settings in the following link for reference:
 
 https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027945/windows-change-privacy-settings-in-windows-10
 
 Microsoft also offers a Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionality Baseline package if privacy is your focus then you should download the restricted baseline package instead of the security hardening instruction mentioned earlier in this documentation. The following link contains the restircted baseline package:
 
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/privacy/manage-connections-from-windows-operating-system-components-to-microsoft-services
 
 The direct URL to download the Windows Restricted Traffic Limited Functionlity Baseline:
 
 https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=828887
 
 Once you Extract the ZIP file you can run the CMD file as seen in the screenshot below. Make sure you put LGPO.exe in WindowsRTLFB\Version 2004\Enterprise\Tools:

 ## Windows 10 References and Post hardening checklist

Ensure Windows 10 Block at First sight is turned on
    
Reference URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-defender-antivirus/configure-block-at-first-sight-windows-defender-antivirus

What about Speculative execution CPU vulnerabilities as referenced in this URL where you have to manually inject registry keys?

https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4073119/protect-against-speculative-execution-side-channel-vulnerabilities-in

This appears to not be needed. See screenshot below on running powershell to get speculative control settings:
